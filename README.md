# UNIVERSAL
A middle-level codebase. I find some codebases are too high level. It's hard to change layers, pipeline, learning framework etc. However, some are too low, which means you cannot implement an idea ASAP.
So I decide to make wheels! My goal is make code transparaent (low level) and easy to implement idea (high level). Please check my projects to see how to use this framework. 

So far it works but is still in progress. I will provide a Document for this project during my postdoc time.
