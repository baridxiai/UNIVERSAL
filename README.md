# UNIVERSAL
A middle-level codebase. I find some codebases (Transformer !) are too high level. It's not transparent to change layers, pipelines, learning frameworks, etc., if you're trying some new ideas without any existing relevant codes. However, some are too low, which means you cannot implement an idea ASAP (Tensor2Tensor !).

So I decided to make wheels! My goal is to make code transparent (low level) and easy to implement ideas (high level). Please check my projects to see how to use this framework. 

So far it works but is still in progress. I will finish this in my Postdoc time and provide instructions. 

## 25 Oct 2023
I reimplemented the framework of UNIVERSAL this month. So some codebases for my paper have changed. I've updated several projects, using the new framework. And I will update them all. If you're interested in papers but the source code is missing now (I make some private now), please send me an email: barid.x.ai at gmail.com. I will make your request in top priority and reimplement it in the new framework.
